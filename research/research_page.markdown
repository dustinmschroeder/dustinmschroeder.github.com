###Thwaites Glacier in the Context of Paleo-Ice-Stream Retreats

Thwaites Glacier is one of the largest, most rapidly changing glaciers on earth with a landward sloping bed that reaches the interior of West Antarctica. Although there are records of melt-water intensive ice-stream retreats on the continental shelf and observations of water driven acceleration in large outlet glaciers, research has focused on the role of ocean-driven melting for Thwaites Glacier.  Using radar souding, I compare the configuration of contemporary subglacial bedforms with those of paleo-ice-streams, showing that although prior retreats across regions of crystalline bedrock progressed quickly, Thwaites Glacier is currently grounded in the middle of one such region and may be poised for a melt-water intensive retreat.

###The Configuration of Subglacial Water Beneath Thwaites Glacier

Subglacial water systems have a diverse range of configurations, however, from an ice flow acceleration perspective, their effect depends on whether the dynamic state of these water bodies as hydrologically distributed or concentrated. Therefore, the sensitivity of ice flow acceleration and grounding line stability of Thwaites Glacier will depend on the existence, locations, and interconnections of these two kinds of systems beneath it.  Using the angular distribution of echo energy, I have been able to provide the first attenuation-independent characterization of the Thwaites Glacier subglacial water system, which consists of a distributed network of canals feeding a system of concentrated channels.  This transition occurs with increasing surface slope, water flux, and basal sheer stress indicating feedback between the subglacial water system and the flow of overlying ice.

###Information and Uncertainty in Radar Constrained Subglacial Water

Despite the high resolution of along-track focused radar data, the survey of Thwaites Glacier was collected on a 15 km grid and simple interpolation does not accurately represent the observational information and uncertainties in these gaps. Using surface and bed topography with a subglacial water model, I was able to invert radar echo information for a physically consistent interpretation of the water system with more geologically realistic spatial patterns and quantified uncertainties.  This approach also provides insight into water depths, conductivity, and geothermal heat flux beneath Thwaites Glacier.

###Characterizing Subglacial Hydrology with Airborne Radar Sounding

Subglacial water networks are pervasive, dynamic systems that can exert strong control on ice flow, but their impact on ice sheet stability and sea level contribution is poorly understood. The large spatial extent and thick ice cover of these systems make airborne radar sounding the only practical means of observation, but limited resolution and uncertainties in attenuation losses make traditional ice penetrating analysis techniques insufficient for observing critical processes. By exploiting advances in ice penetrating radar technology and processing, I have developed new analysis techniques that quantify the angular distribution of echo energy, constrain the sub-resolution configuration of the bed, and provide an attenuation-independent indicator of subglacial water.
