###The Dynamic State of Subglacial Water in Thwaites Glacier, West Antarctica

Subglacial water systems have been observed and theorized to modulate the flow of glaciers and ice sheets. Thwaites Glacier is one of the largest and most rapidly changing glaciers on earth. It is grounded on a landward sloping bed that reached the deep interior of the marine West Antarctic Ice Sheet. This is a potentially unstable configuration and a retreat initiated at its grounding line could spread to the rest of the ice sheet. Despite this potential instability, the subglacial water system beneath Thwaites Glacier and its control on present and future ice flow and stability have yet to be constrained by geophysical observation. This project uses an extensive gridded airborne radar survey of the Thwaites Glacier catchment and new approaches to radar data focusing and anlalysis to study its subglaical water systems and their role in ice flow.

###Thwaites Glacier in the Context of Paleo-Ice-Stream Retreats

Thwaites Glacier is one of the largest, most rapidly changing glaciers on earth, its landward sloping bed reaches the deep interior of West Antarctica, so a retreat started at its grounding line could spread to the rest of the ice sheet. Although there are records of melt-water intensive ice-stream retreats on the continental shelf and observations of basal water driven acceleration in large outlet glaciers, research has focused on the role of ocean-driven melting for Thwaites Glacier.  By adapting focused radar analysis techniques, I have been able compare the configuration of contemporary subglacial bedforms with those of paleo-ice-streams, showing that although prior retreats across regions of exposed crystalline bedrock progressed relatively quickly, Thwaites Glacier is currently grounded in the middle of one such region and may therefore be poised for a melt-water intensive retreat.
