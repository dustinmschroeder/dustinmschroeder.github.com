###Thwaites Glacier Sediments the Context of Paleo-Ice-Stream Retreats

Thwaites Glacier is one of the largest, most rapidly changing glaciers on earth with a landward sloping bed that reaches the interior of West Antarctica. Although there are records of melt-water intensive ice-stream retreats on the continental shelf and observations of water driven acceleration in large outlet glaciers, research has focused on the role of ocean-driven melting for Thwaites Glacier.  Using radar souding, we compare the configuration of contemporary subglacial bedforms with those of paleo-ice-streams. We find that Thwaites Glacier is currently grounded on a region with a bed configuration similar to the paleo Pine Island Glacier when it retreated across the inner continental shelf. Therefore, it may be poised to experience a retreat with similar character and pacing.

###The Configuration of Subglacial Water Beneath Thwaites Glacier

From an ice flow acceleration perspective, the effect of subglacial water depends on whether the dynamic state of these water bodies is hydrologically distributed or concentrated. The sensitivity of ice flow acceleration and grounding line stability of Thwaites Glacier will depend on the existence, locations, and interconnections of these systems beneath it.  Using the specularity of radar echos, we provide the first attenuation-independent characterization of the Thwaites Glacier subglacial water system, which consists of a distributed network of canals feeding a system of concentrated channels.  This transition occurs with increasing surface slope, water flux, and basal sheer stress indicating feedback between the ice and water systems.

###Heterogeneous Geothermal Heat Flux Beneath Thwaites Glacier

Despite the high resolution of along-track focused radar data, the survey of Thwaites Glacier was collected on a 15 km grid and simple interpolation does not accurately represent the observational information and uncertainties in these gaps. Using surface and bed topography with a subglacial water model, we invert radar echo information for a physically consistent interpretation of the water system with more geologically realistic spatial patterns. The resulting estimate of basal melt provides the first catchmenent-wide evidence for elevated and spatially heterogenous geothermal heat flux beneath Thwaites Glacier and the West Antarctic Ice Sheet. The location, values, and geologic context of the high flux areas are consistent with hypothesized rift-assocaited volcanism and magma migration from the West Antarctic Rift System.

###Characterizing Subglacial Hydrology with Airborne Radar Sounding

Subglacial water networks are pervasive, dynamic systems that can exert strong control on ice flow. The large spatial extent and thick ice cover of these systems make airborne radar sounding the only practical means of observation, but limited resolution and uncertainties in attenuation losses make traditional ice penetrating analysis techniques insufficient for observing critical processes. By exploiting advances in ice penetrating radar technology and processing, we have developed new analysis techniques that quantify the angular distribution of echo energy, constrain the sub-resolution configuration of the bed, and provide an attenuation-independent indicator of subglacial water.

### Volume Scattering in Europa's Ice Regolith 

The surface of Europa has been hypothesized to include an ice regolith layer from hundreds of meters to kilometers in thickness. However, contrary to previous claims, it does not present a significant obstacle to searching for Europa’s ocean with radar sounding. By using a Radar Cross Section based scattering model, this note shows that even with regolith thicknesses over 1.6 km, cavities at the wavelength scale, and porosities greater than 5%, volume scattering losses amount to less than 0.25% of the signal from an ice/ocean interface. Therefore, scattering in Europa’s ice regolith does not pose major obstacle to radar penetration.

###The University of Texas HiCARS II and MARFA Airborne Radar Sounders

The University of Texas Institute for Geophysics (UTIG) collects airborne geophysical data over Arctic and Antarctic ice sheets and glaciers.  As a graduate student and member of UTIG field and technical teams, I led the RF development, maintenance, and operation of the new HiCARS II radar system. This system builds on the legacy of the original UTIG HiCARS radar system with coherent acquisition, range-migrated focusing, and linked high-accuracy time stamping. It also adds simultaneously acquired 2MHz radar sounding to the existing 60 MHz system. The migration of primary survey operations to the HiCARS II system in 2011 allowed for improved real-time QC and more robust spares and upgrades with an all UTIG developed system. In 2013, the University of Texas radar sounder was also modified to include two cross-track phase centers for off-nadir clutter discrimination.

###Planetary Radar Sounders

Although there are significant theoretical commonalities between airborne and satellite ice penetrating radar systems, the limitations in power, processing, and data volume make radar sounders for planetary exploration a distinct design challenge. As part of the Radar Sounder Working Group for ESA's Jupiter Icy Moon Explorer mission, I participated in the definition and proposal of a single-frequency ice penetrating radar.  NASA's Europa Science Definition Team (SDT) has studied the Europa Clipper mission concept that includes a dual-frequency, multi-channel radar sounder.  As a technical assistant to the SDT and member of the ICEE (Instrument Concepts for Europa Exploration) Ice Penetrating Radar project, I am helping to develop a radar sounding instrument capable of meeting the science and reconnaissance requirements of the Clipper mission concept.

###The ICECAP Project and Operation Ice Bridge, Antarctica

The ICECAP Project (Investigation the Cryospheric Evolution of the Central Antarctic Plate) began as a large international airborne geophysical survey of previously underexplored regions of East Antarctica in the international polar year and has grown in to a continuing international collaboration (including the US, the UK, Australia, France, Italy, Germany, Denmark, Chile, and Argentina) with projects spanning the cryosphere. We collect simultaneous dual frequency radar, gravity, magnetic, gps, and scanning-photon-counting-lidar data. As a member of the 08-09, 09-10, and 10-11 ICECAP Antarctic field teams, I served as the lead RF field engineer and radar operator for surveys of the Aurora Subglacial Basin, Byrd Glacier, and Astrolabe Glacier.
