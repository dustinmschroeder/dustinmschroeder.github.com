## Geophysical Glaciology: Ice Penetraing Radar 
![Alt text](/images/antenna.jpg)

I have developed and taught an unofficial course on the physical, technical, and glaciological principles of ice penetrating radar at the University of Texas Institute for Geophysics (UTIG) in Spring 2010 and Spring 2013. The course was developed to fill a gap in training for graduate students in our airborne cryoshere geophysics group (and other planetary and glaciology groups at UTIG). It covers the fundamental concepts, physics, and techniques required to approach radio-glaciology and ice penetrating radar in a quantitative way. It also provides the theoretical foundation and disciplinary context to develop and evaluate research approaches based on the full information and uncertainty in ice penetrating radar.

## The Liberal Arts and Sciences Academy 

![Alt text](/images/lasa.jpg)

I have been a volunteer coach and mentor for the high school Science Olympiad team at the Liberal Arts and Science Academy in Austin, Texas since 2007. The students on the fifteen-person team compete in twenty-three events that span physics, chemistry, earth and space science, life science, technology, and inquiry into the nature of science. I help facilitate the student leadership of the team and provide expertise and guidance on the earth science and engineering focused events. The team has won first place in the state of Texas for every year that I have been a volunteer coach and has finished in the top ten in the nation for four years in a row (the first team to do so from the southwest).

**Team Placement Nationally:** 

**30th**(2007), **19th**(2008), **8th**(2009), **7th**(2010), **9th**(2011), **7th**(2012)

## National Science Olympiad

![Alt text](/images/national_medals.jpg)

Science Olympiad is the nation's largest team-based science competition.  I have been a member of the National Science Olympiad’s governing Earth and Space Science Committee since 2003.  The committee is responsible for the development and supervision of events for high school and middle school students on topics spanning astronomy, planetary science, glaciology, hydrology, climate, oceanography, meteorology, rocks and minerals, fossils, geography, and remote sensing.  I have also served as National Event Co-Supervisor for the High School Astronomy Event (2003 - 2011) and National Event Supervisor for the Middle School Championship (2012 - present). I have also co-created trial events on geologic mapping and antenna design.
