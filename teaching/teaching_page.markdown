## Geophysical Glaciology: Ice Penetrating Radar 
![Alt text](/images/antenna.jpg)

I developed and taught a course on the physical, technical, and glaciological principles of ice penetrating radar at the University of Texas Institute for Geophysics (UTIG) in the Spring of 2010 and Spring of 2013. The course was developed to fill a gap in training for graduate students in our airborne cryoshere geophysics group (and other planetary and glaciology groups at UTIG). It covers the fundamental concepts, physics, and techniques required to approach radio-glaciology and ice penetrating radar in a quantitative way. It also provides the theoretical foundation and disciplinary context to develop and evaluate research approaches based on the information and uncertainty in ice penetrating radar.

## The Liberal Arts and Sciences Academy 

![Alt text](/images/lasa.jpg)

I served a volunteer coach and mentor for the high school Science Olympiad team at the Liberal Arts and Science Academy in Austin, Texas. The students on the fifteen-person team competed in twenty-three events that span physics, chemistry, earth and space science, life science, technology, and inquiry into the nature of science. I helped facilitate the student leadership of the team and provided expertise and guidance on the earth science and engineering focused events. LASA was the team from the Southwest to finished in the Top Ten in the Nation for four years in a row.

**Team Placement Nationally:** 

**30th**(2007), **19th**(2008), **8th**(2009), **7th**(2010), **9th**(2011), **7th**(2012)

## National Science Olympiad

![Alt text](/images/national_medals.jpg)

Science Olympiad is the nation's largest team-based science competition.  I have been a member of the National Science Olympiad’s Earth and Space Science Committee since 2003.  The committee is responsible for the development and supervision of events for high school and middle school students on topics spanning astronomy, planetary science, glaciology, hydrology, climate, oceanography, meteorology, rocks and minerals, fossils, geography, and remote sensing.  I have also served as National Event Co-Supervisor for the High School Astronomy Event (2003 - 2011), National Event Supervisor for the Middle School Astronomy Event (2011 - 2013), and National Event Supervisor for the Middle School Planetary Science Event (2013 - present), for which I coordinate UTIG's sponsorship. I have also helped to co-create the High School Geologic Mapping event and and a trial event on Antenna Design.

## Mentoring

<font color="#f0f0f0"> </font> 

My membership in large research groups, experience as a volunteer high school science coach, and participation in the national leadership of Science Olympiad have provided me with opportunities to mentor a diverse and exceptional group of young scientists, engineers, and thinkers. I am deeply proud of them and am honored to have been part of their education.
