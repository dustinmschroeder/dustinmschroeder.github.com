## About Me

## About My Research Interests

I am interested in the use of geophysical radar remote sensing to study water in all its phases and configurations in the earth system. Currently, my research focuses on the characterization of subglacial water using airborne radar sounding. Subglacial water systems have the potential to facilitate or trigger ice sheet retreat and increased rates of sea level rise.  I study the effect of subglacial water on ice sheet flow and also develop new radar analysis techniques to characterize that water. I approach observational science as a system: from instrument development to survey design, data processing, parameter estimation, modeling, and inference. Within that framework, I am particularly interested in the transmission of information and uncertainty between each step and using that understanding to adapt the system to answer fundamental questions about the natural world. I aspire to be both an observational geoscientist with a deep understanding of the instruments I use as well as a geophysical radar engineer with a deep understanding of the science for which I design instruments. This deliberate combination of earth system science and radar system engineering provides a powerful and intellectually rich perspective for the study of water in this and other geophysical settings (i.e. surface water, soil moisture, oceans, precipitation, planetary ice).
