## About Me

<div style="float: left;margin:0px 15px 0px 0px;"><img src="/images/picture.jpg" /> </div>

Currently, I am a radar geophysicist and system engineer with NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory at the California Institute of Technology.  My research focuses on subglacial water systems beneath rapidly changing marine ice sheets and the use of ice penetrating radar to study them.  

In general, I am interested in the fundamental problem of observing, understanding, and predicting the interaction of ice and water in the earth system.  

In particular, I am interested in the role that subglacial water systems play in the evolution and stability of continental ice sheets and their potential contribution to the rate of sea level rise. I am also interested in the development, use, and analysis of geophysical radar remote sensing systems that are optimized to observe hypothesis-specific phenomena.  

I aspire to approach problems as both an observational geoscientist as well as geophysical radar system engineer by focusing on the flow of information and uncertainty through each step of the observational science processes (from instrument and survey design, through data processing and analysis, to modeling and inference). 

I believe that this deliberate combination of earth system science and radar system engineering is a powerful and intellectually rich approach to research on subglacial hydrology as well a wide range of other geophysical problems, processes, and settings (i.e. the radio geophysical exploration of icy planets).
