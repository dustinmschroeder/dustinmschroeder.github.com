## About Me

<div style="float: left;margin:0px 15px 0px 0px;"><img src="/images/picture.jpg" /> </div>

Currently, I am doctoral candidate in geophysics in the Jackson School of Geoscience at the University of Texas at Austin.  My reseach focuses on subglacial water systems beneath rapidly changing marine ice sheets and the use of ice penetrating radar to study them.  

In general, I am interested in the fundamental problem of observing, understanding, and predicting the interaction of ice and water in the earth system.  

In particular,I am interested in the role that subglacial water systems play in the evolution and stability of continental ice sheets and their potential contribution to the rate of sea level rise. I am also interested in the development, use, and analysis of geophysical radar remote sensing systems that are optimized to observe hypothesis-specific phenomena.  

In my research, I aspire to approach problems as both an observational geoscientist as well as geophysical radar system engineer by focusing on the flow of information and uncertainty through each step of the observational science processes (from instrument and survey design, through data processing and analysis, to modeling and inference). 

This deliberate combination of earth system science and radar system engineering is a powerful and intellectually rich approach both in my specific research on subglacial hydrology and in its potential application to a wide range of other geophysical problems, processes, and settings.
