## About Me

<div style="float: left;margin:0px 15px 0px 0px;"><img src="/images/picture.jpg" /> </div>

I am a doctoral candidate in geophysics in the Jackson School of Geoscience at the University of Texas at Austin.  My reseach focuses on subglacial water systems beneath  rapidly changing marine ice sheets and the use of ice penetrating radar to study them.  

In general, I am interested in the use of geophysical radar remote sensing to study the distribution and behavior of water and ice in the earth system and on planetary bodies. In paricular, my research currently focuses on the characterization of water systems beneath the catchment of Thwaites Glacier in West Antarctica using focused airborne ice penetrating radar sounding.  Thwaites Glacier is on of the lagest and most rapidly changing glaciers on earth and the effect of

and its subglacial water systems may have the potential to facilitate an unstable retreat capable of spreading to the rest of ice sheet.  My work seeks to assess that potential by constraining the configuration of subglacial water systems and their influence on ice sheet flow and stability.

In approaching 

I aspire to be both an observational geoscientist with a deep understanding of the instruments I use as well as a geophysical radar engineer with a deep understanding of the science for which I design instruments. 

I approach observational science as a system: from instrument development to survey design, data processing, parameter estimation, modeling, and inference. 

Within that framework, I am particularly interested in the transmission of information and uncertainty between each step and using that understanding to adapt the system to answer fundamental questions about the natural world. 

This deliberate combination of earth system science and radar system engineering provides a powerful and intellectually rich perspective for the study of water in this and other geophysical settings (i.e. surface water, soil moisture, oceans, precipitation, planetary ice).
